## GET methods
A successful GET method typically returns HTTP status code 200 (OK). If the resource cannot be found, the method should return 404 (Not Found).

If the request was fulfilled but there is no response body included in the HTTP response, then it should return HTTP status code 204 (No Content); for example, a search operation yielding no matches might be implemented with this behavior.

## POST methods
If a POST method creates a new resource, it returns HTTP status code 201 (Created). The URI of the new resource is included in the Location header of the response. The response body contains a representation of the resource.
